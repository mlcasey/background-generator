My System for PPT Creation

SPX weekly options only
Generally try for 10 Delta ICs (except on Fridays ==> 5 Delta)

Position Sizing
When VIX is < 15
1 contract per $1,500 of account value

When Vix is 15 < > 20
1 contract per $3,000 of account value

When Vix is 20 < > 25
1 contract per $5,000 of account value

When VIX is > 25
Eith er do nothing or buy straddles?

Other elements:
Do new 10 Delta positions only on:
Tuesday for Wednesday (2 DTE)
Thursday for Friday (2 DTE)
Do new 5 Delta positions for Monday expiration

Do not place new trades on Mondays or Wednesdays

When I have to roll out an IC into a LIC.

Threatened breach
Partial breach
Complete breach

Change the speed an frequency of trading.

Either use Chris' Turning Points approach to sell only the credit spread predicted by the TP analysis for the next expiration day

OR

Sell a LOT more time on the roll (up to 3 weeks) in order to defray the cost of the complete breach being covered.

This is like turning down the speed of a conveyor belt in a manufacturing facility.

Here is Chris's study called TrendviewNorm for TOS charts:

declare lower;
input FP = 5;
input FP5 = 10;
input FP6 = 20;
# input SM=1;

def DIRC = (close - close[1]) / 2;
def DIR2C = (DIRC - DIRC[1]) / 2;
def SLOPEC = DIRC - DIR2C;

def TVC = ExpAverage(SLOPEC, FP) * 1;
def TVC5 = ExpAverage(SLOPEC, FP5) * 1;
def TVC6 = ExpAverage(SLOPEC, FP6) * 1;
def TRD = TrueRange(high, close, low);
def TRC = If high-low<average(high-low,100)/50 then TRD[1] else TRD;


plot CloseTrend5 = TVC * 4 / Average(TRC, FP);
plot CloseTrend10 = TVC5 * 4 / Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), FP5);
plot CloseTrend20 = TVC6 * 4 / Average(TrueRange(high, close, low), FP6);
